Slyblime is Sylvester the Cat's Common Lisp IDE for **Sublime Text 4**:

Slyblime is an implementation of [SLY](https://github.com/joaotavora/sly) and uses the same backend (SLYNK). 

Currently it includes:

* REPL integration including backtracking
* Autocomplete and documentation
* References, disassembly, macroexpansion etc.
* Inspection support
* Tracing support
* Compilation support with notes
* Multiple connexions
* Debugger including stack frame inspection
* **NEW!** Ability to open an inferior Lisp directly from the editor!

The primary missing feature is the ability to use stickers from Sly.

## Installation
First install [SublimeREPL](https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL) and this plugin.
Use Package Control to install them, or download and unzip the plugins in your packages folder.
Then type `Sly: Upgrade SublimeREPL to work with Sly` into the command palette.
Finally, to get started just run `Sly: Start and connect to an inferior Lisp instance` in the command palette (you may need to change the default lisp program in the settings).

## Usage
Make sure to install SublimeREPL (via Package Control) and then running `Sly: Upgrade SublimeREPL to work with Sly` into the command palette before attempting to use Slyblime!

### Using an inferior Lisp

Go to the settings and set the inferior lisp command to what you want (by default it's `lisp`).
After that run `Sly: Start and connect to an inferior Lisp instance` to start a inferior lisp and REPL.

### External connexion
To connect to a Slynk instance run `Sly: Connect to slynk` using the command palette.
Make sure to use the included `Lisp+` syntax for all the features to work correctly.

#### Pathname translation

To use pathname translation, create file `Sublime Text/Packages/User/slyblime/filename_translators.py`.
Then at the top add `from slyblime.filename_translation import *`.
A pathname translator is any class definition which extends the (`slyblime.filename_translation.`)`PathnameTranslator` abstract class as follows:
```python
class PathnameTranslator():
    # Tells Slyblime if the translator should be offered for the current connexion
    def is_active(self, session: SlynkSession) -> bool
    def local_to_remote(self, pathname: str) -> str
    def remote_to_local(self, pathname: str) -> str
    # A two line description of the translator for the selection menu
    description: Tuple[str, str]
``` For most cases, it is preferable to use extend the (`slyblime.filename_translation.`)`SimpleTranslator` abstract class:
```python
class SimpleTranslator(PathnameTranslator):
    local_stem:str
    remote_stem:str
    def is_active(self, session: SlynkSession) -> bool
``` where a bijection is created such that path "`local_stem`/*A*" â‰ƒ "`remote_stem`/*A*".

## Developping

The recommended way to develop is to clone this repo somewhere, then symlink the `src` folder to the Sublime packages folder and symlink the `sly` submodule folder into the `src` folder. While this may seem convolouted, this allows almost all files to remain toplevel in the package folder which means that Sublime Text will reload them upon modification, speeding up editing speed.
